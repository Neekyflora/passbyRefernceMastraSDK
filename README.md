## 📖 Description

Tool Output Variables for Mastra Agents is designed to help create multi-turn AI agents that work faster and save costs. Our approach lets agents pass data by reference instead of requiring them to repeatedly rewrite the same outputs. This efficiency reduces redundant processing and conserves resources.

## ❓ The Problem

AI agents often do busy work that wastes time and resources. Here’s how this happens:

1. **Step 1** – The user asks a question. The agent calls a tool and receives a large chunk of data, like 50 customer records.
  
2. **Step 2** – The agent must then decide whether to pass this information to a tool for further analysis or deliver it directly to the user.
    - **Re-write Issue**: The agent must remember this large data structure. This means re-entering the same data either as input for another tool or sending it to the user.
    - This leads to wasted time and an increase in token usage.

By requiring the model to re-author large data sets every time it needs to share them, we incur significant costs in both time and resources.

## 💡 The Idea

Imagine if the agent could simply reference existing data instead. We enable that possibility. By streamlining the process, our tool helps you save time and reduce costs.

## 🚀 Features

- **Data Reference Management**: Easily manage multiple datasets without re-inputting them.
- **Efficiency**: Speed up the workflow for AI agents by cutting down on redundant tasks.
- **Flexible Integration**: Work with various tools seamlessly for enhanced performance.
- **User-Friendly**: Designed for users without programming backgrounds, making it easy for anyone to use.

## 📦 System Requirements

For optimum performance, ensure your system meets the following requirements:

- Operating System: Windows 10 or later, macOS Mojave or later, or any Linux distribution from 2020 or later.
- RAM: Minimum 4 GB; Recommended 8 GB.
- Processor: Dual-core or better.
- Network: Stable internet connection for downloading and tool integration.
